Maven is a build automation tool primarily used for Java projects. It simplifies the process of building and managing Java projects by providing a uniform build system, project management, and dependency management.

Here's how Maven is typically used in a Java application:

Project Structure: Maven imposes a standard project structure. Your source code goes into the src/main/java directory, resources into src/main/resources, and test code into src/test/java, with resources for testing in src/test/resources.

POM (Project Object Model): Maven uses a Project Object Model (POM) file, typically named pom.xml, to describe the project configuration. This XML file contains project-specific information such as dependencies, plugins, and other settings. It's the heart of a Maven project.

Dependency Management: One of the key features of Maven is its dependency management. In the pom.xml file, you specify the dependencies your project relies on. Maven then downloads these dependencies from a central repository (like Maven Central) and includes them in your project's classpath automatically. This eliminates the need to manually manage JAR files and their dependencies.

Build Lifecycle: Maven defines a standard build lifecycle consisting of phases like compile, test, package, install, and deploy. Each phase represents a different stage in the build process. By running Maven commands like mvn compile, mvn test, or mvn package, you execute these phases in sequence.

Plugins: Maven's functionality can be extended through plugins. Plugins allow you to perform additional tasks during the build process, such as generating documentation, running tests, or packaging your application into an executable JAR file. Maven plugins are configured in the pom.xml file.

Convention over Configuration: Maven follows the principle of "convention over configuration," meaning it relies on a set of conventions and defaults to streamline project setup and management. This reduces the need for manual configuration and helps maintain consistency across projects.

JUnit : This configuration tells Maven to include JUnit version 3.8.1 as a dependency in your project. When you build your project, Maven will automatically download the JUnit library from the Maven Central Repository (or another repository configured in your pom.xml file) and add it to your project's classpath. You can then use JUnit to write and execute tests in your Java project.
